*Opinions that my friend ironically calls **Rob's Rules***


### Work

* Don't undervalue your work. Charge more.
* Have a go-to-market strategy before building the product.

### Life

* Don't deflect when receiving a compliment; say thank you.
* Take the weekend off; do something that's nothing to do with work.
* Be aware of the value of time. Time is _expensive_.
